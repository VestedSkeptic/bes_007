Q: Is there a way I can add a magic comment or something like that to the end of the line to make PyDev ignore 
the false error, similar to how you can sprinkle comments like "# pylint: disable-msg=E1101" to make PyLint 
ignore errors?

A: Add the hash character # at the end of the line then with the cursor on the flagged error, press Ctrl-1. 
One of the options in the menu will be something like @UndefinedVariable. Adding this comment will cause PyDev 
to ignore the error.
